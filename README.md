# Establishing and Evaluating Access to Scientific Data -- EUDAT Human Brain Project

This is the code + documentation belonging to a semester project. The aim of this project was to insert scientific data from the EUDAT Human Brain Project into the Rasdaman database. 

## Code
The code can be found in the file [src/code.py](src/nii_to_tiff.py) and depends on nibabel, numpy and tiffile.py to be installed. These dependencies are not included in this project, the script will automatically provide installation instructions if they are missing. Due to uncertainty in licensing, the dataset itself is not included in this repository either. 

## Documentation
The documentation can be found in [doc/BDCCreport.pdf](doc/BDCCreport.pdf).
